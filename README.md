# NeighborhoodMap

### Purpose
This is the final project for the Udactity Front End NanoDegree. No starter code was provided.

### Built Using:
* React (via Create-React-App) <br />
&nbsp; *Note: this project uses _no_ outside React libraries or wrappers
* Google Maps API (javascript)
* Foursquare API (to pull 'tips')
* Responsive Design (CSS Grid, CSS Breakpoints)


### Want to run this app yourself?
To get this app running locally:
* Download contents of repo to local destination
* In your command line navigate to the 'neighborhood-map' folder
* Type &nbsp; `npm start`


### Features
This app generates a Google Map instance and then populates it with pre-selected locations. <br /> <br />
For this project I chose 5 of my favorite coffee shops around St. Louis.
<br /> <br />
You can filter each marker individually and click on the marker itself to see an InfoWindow containing: <br />
* The location name
* Address
* A _Tip_ from Foursquare about the location
