# SillyStories
### Project build for a Silly Story generator game

&nbsp;&nbsp; Silly Stories is a fun filled story generator. Give us a few words and we'll give you a Silly Story!

&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply select which game summary sounds interesting, fill out our form with the correct (or IN-correct) types of words, and then submit to produce an odd, entertaining, and often nonsensical story that will get your giggler bubbling.


## Project components

This project consists of these basic components:
* Landing page to select a story summary
* A form page to input words that will be placed in the story
* A story page that displays the story with user input inserted
* [Hopefully] will be able to add a save/share feature at some point
